# Fabric-fault Detection using AI and Machine Learning
Hi! This repository contains the files for my Major Individual Project in my undergraduate
(The dataset was labelled and gathered by me)

# MATLAB toolboxes required
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox Model for YOLO v4 Object Detection

# Methods of Testing Object Detector
1) Open  Evaluate.mlx and run the first three lines of code
2) Create a new live editor and load trainingDetector.mat and run the line of code:
   `detectionResults = detect(trainingDetector,testData);`
3) Open **TestingImages.mlx**, load **imdsTest** and change the value of n between the values of 1-270

# Recreate the program from scratch
If you want to follow the development of the program as mentioned in the methodology, run the following **.mlx** files in the order below:
1) Database.mlx
2) Network.mlx
3) Data_Augmentation.mlx
4) Train_Network.mlx
